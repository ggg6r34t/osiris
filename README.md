# 🔍 Osiris

**A single-operator investigation workbench for brand abuse, phishing, and executive protection.**

Osiris began as an OSINT link engine and grew into a full **investigation platform** — a CLI *and* a web
workbench that carries a case through its whole lifecycle: **discover → assess → decide → act → monitor**. It
generates OSINT pivots, enriches and scores domains, resolves who to report abuse to, profiles a VIP's digital
exposure, files findings into cases, and watches targets for change — alerting you when something new appears.

Think of it as a personal **Digital Risk Protection (DRP)** / brand-abuse & executive-protection console, scoped
to one operator. Everything runs locally; enrichment integrations are opt-in and degrade gracefully without keys.

## 🚀 What it does

**Discover**
- OSINT search-link generation across categorized platforms (social, apps, web, messengers, marketplaces, …),
  with fuzzy matching, filtering, batch mode, threat scoring, reachability checks, and CSV/JSON/TXT export.
- Lookalike / typosquat discovery (certificate-transparency **Domain Match**, **DNSTwist** permutations),
  **Clone Detect**, and **IP Pivot** (reverse-IP co-hosted domains).

**Assess**
- **Enrich** — WHOIS/DNS/hosting/SSL/favicon + threat intel (VirusTotal, urlscan, AbuseIPDB) and a computed
  risk score; bulk mode + exports.
- **VIP Investigation** — a protective-intelligence exposure scorecard for a person (online presence, service
  discoverability, geo risk, impersonations → High/Med/Low + overall score, with investigator pivots).

**Act**
- **Abuse Router** — for any domain, resolves *who to report to* (registrar, hosting/CDN, email provider) with
  abuse-email or web-form links + an escalation path, and reads DNS/MX/RDAP to tell whether it's still live or
  already taken down. Pre-filled takedown emails, screenshots, IOC/PDF/CSV exports.

**Persist & monitor**
- **Cases & history** — a local investigation workspace (SQLite) with per-finding status/notes.
- **Monitoring** — a watchlist that re-runs lookalike scans and highlights new domains vs. the last run, with
  optional **Telegram / webhook alerts** and a cron-friendly `osiris --monitor`.

---

## 🧩 Use cases

- Run a brand-abuse / phishing investigation end to end: find lookalikes, assess them, route the takedown, file
  the case, and monitor for new impersonations.
- Check whether a fraudulent domain or email is still operational (or already suspended) from its DNS/MX/RDAP state.
- Produce a defensive digital-exposure profile for an executive/VIP (authorized protective-intelligence / DRP).
- Triage and enrich domains at scale, then export IOCs/reports for downstream tools.
- Extend it to your environment: custom search platforms, abuse-contact and geo-risk overrides — all via JSON.

> **Scope:** Osiris is a **local, single-operator** tool by design — no auth, local SQLite, opt-in enrichment,
> and several signals (handle resolution, mention volume, geo tier, liveness verdicts) are heuristics meant to
> guide an analyst, not to be authoritative. That's the line between it and a hosted, multi-tenant DRP product.

## 📦 Installation

1. **Ensure you have Python 3.9 or higher installed.** Check your version:

   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```

   If you see Python 2.x, install or upgrade to Python 3 (e.g., via your package manager or from https://python.org).

2. **(Optional but recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment** to isolate dependencies:
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows PowerShell:
     ```powershell
     python -m venv venv
     .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
     ```

3. Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ggg6r34t/osiris.git
   cd osiris
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   💡 If `pip` still points to Python 2, use `pip3` instead:

   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Make the main script executable (if needed):

   ```bash
   chmod +x osiris
   ```

6. (Optional) Install the CLI entrypoint so `osiris` works anywhere:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

---

## 🧠 Usage

Run a search on a target across selected platforms:

```bash
./osiris Tesla --platforms web social_networks --export csv --open
```

Or, if installed with `pip install -e .`:

```bash
osiris Tesla --platforms web social_networks --export csv --open
```

Or directly with Python:

```bash
python3 osiris Tesla --platforms web social_networks --export csv --open
```

Use `-h` or `--help` to see all available options and flags:

```bash
./osiris --help
```

````

## 🧩 Adding Custom Platforms

You can extend the default platform database by providing your own custom platforms using the
`--add-custom-platform` flag.

```bash
./osiris --add-custom-platform "web" "Google" "https://www.google.com/search?q={query}"
````

### Custom JSON Format

```json
{
  "web": {
    "Google": "https://www.google.com/search?q={query}"
  },
  "social_networks": {
    "Facebook": "https://www.facebook.com/search/top?q={query}"
  }
}
```

## 🌐 Web workbench

The primary interface is a web workbench under `web/` (Next.js) backed by a FastAPI server (`osiris.api`),
organized into sections — **Search**, **Domain Tools**, **VIP**, **Cases**, **Custom Platforms**, and
**Settings**:

- **Search** — target (single or batch), platform/category picker, and an Options panel exposing the CLI's
  search flags: fuzzy matching, dedupe, threat scoring + sort-by-score, max-links, exclude platforms/categories,
  tag, and server-side logging. Results are grouped by category with per-row/per-category/all selection, staggered
  **Open selected** in new tabs (max-open / randomize), **Check** reachability (live/dead badges +
  "reachable only" filter), copy, and CSV/JSON/TXT export.
- **Domain Tools** — the domain-intelligence modes: **Enrich** (WHOIS/DNS/hosting/SSL/favicon/threat-intel with a
  computed risk score), **Abuse Router** (for any domain: resolves *who to report abuse to* — registrar, hosting/CDN,
  email provider — with abuse-email **or web-form** links and an ordered escalation path, plus a live-status verdict
  from DNS/MX/RDAP status codes to tell whether a fraudulent domain/email is still up or already taken down; includes
  blocklist/browser reporting channels and a pre-filled report email; keyless RDAP+DNS, abuse map overridable via
  `abuse_contacts.json`), **Domain Match** (certificate-transparency lookalikes), **DNSTwist** (permutation scan),
  **IP Pivot** (reverse-IP: other domains co-hosted on the same IP + ASN/host facts), **Clone Detect**
  (byte-identical typosquat clones), **Brand Abuse (regex)** (regex search over the internal Panda
  dataset, with a built-in **Generate regex from a brand** helper that turns a brand/domain into a
  homoglyph/typosquat pattern), **Text Clone** and **Phishing Dorks** (dork-link builders), and **Deep Search** (all of the above
  combined). These make outbound network calls and can be slow; results are cached in-process for ~1 hour so
  re-querying is instant.
- **Cases** — a local investigation workspace (SQLite `osiris.db`, gitignored): **Cases** (group findings,
  per-item status/notes, "Add to case" from Enrich), **Takedowns** (track a domain's takedown through its
  lifecycle — new → reported → down → **relisted** — with an event timeline, aging, and auto re-checks that flag
  when a reported domain goes dark or comes back; "Track takedown" from the Abuse Router, `osiris --check-takedowns`
  for cron, Telegram/webhook alerts on change), **Monitor** (watchlist that re-runs Domain Match + DNSTwist
  and highlights newly-registered lookalikes vs. the last run — also `osiris --monitor` for cron), and **History**
  (recent runs). Enrich also has **bulk** mode, per-tool **CSV/JSON export**, a **↻ refresh** (cache bypass), a
  **takedown/abuse-email** generator, and **screenshots** of suspect pages.
- **Intake** — turn reports into structured intelligence. **IOC Extract** takes a pasted alert/report/email body,
  **refangs** defanged text (`hxxp`, `evil[.]com`, `user[at]host`), and extracts deduped indicators (domains, IPs,
  URLs, emails, MD5/SHA-1/SHA-256, CVEs) — then exports a **STIX 2.1 bundle** or **MISP event JSON** (importable,
  keyless) or files the indicators to a case. Case exports also gained **STIX** and **MISP** buttons.
- **VIP Investigation** — a protective-intelligence exposure scorecard for a person (executive-protection / DRP).
  Enter a VIP (name/aliases, emails, known handles, company, country) and Osiris scores four dimensions
  **High / Medium / Low** — online-presence volume (cross-platform handle resolution), service-account
  discoverability (breach exposure via HIBP + resolution), geo-location risk, and impersonations
  (investigator-confirmed) — plus an overall exposure score and investigator pivots (presence/handle discovery,
  impersonation hunt, family/relatives, business/associates, geo/location). It measures *risk levels* and hands
  you pivots — it does not harvest or store sensitive personal content. Save a scorecard to a case.
- **Custom Platforms** — add/list/remove user platforms (persisted to `custom_platforms.json`).
- **Settings** — User-Agent, request timeout, rate limit, HTTP(S) proxy, Tor, and TLS verification.

The web UI now covers the full CLI surface except a few flags that are inherently CLI/host-specific
(`--browser`/`--list-browsers`, `--save-dir`/`--output`, `--json`, `--no-banner`, `--config`).

### Run it (production, one command)

From the repo root (with the venv created and `pip install -e .` done):

```bash
./run.sh            # builds the frontend if needed, then starts both servers
./run.sh --build    # force a fresh production build first
```

Then open http://localhost:3000. Ctrl+C stops both servers. Ports can be overridden with
`OSIRIS_BACKEND_PORT` / `OSIRIS_FRONTEND_PORT`.

### Run it (development, two terminals)

```bash
# Terminal 1 — backend API (from repo root, with the venv active)
uvicorn osiris.api:app --reload --port 8000

# Terminal 2 — frontend
cd web && npm install && npm run dev
```

By default the frontend calls the API at `http://localhost:8000`; override with `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`
(see `web/.env.local.example`).

### Backend configuration (optional)

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (gitignored) and fill in what you need — `run.sh` loads it automatically:

- **Brand Abuse (regex) tool** requires the internal Panda API (VPN): `OSIRIS_PANDA_URL`, `OSIRIS_PANDA_LOGIN`,
  `OSIRIS_PANDA_KEY`. Without them the tool returns a clear "not configured" message.
- **Enrichment** API keys (optional, degrade gracefully): `ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY`, `SECURITYTRAILS_API_KEY`, `IPINFO_TOKEN`,
  `VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY` (adds VirusTotal detections + reputation to Enrich and the risk score). urlscan.io reputation
  and IP-Pivot reverse-IP work without keys (rate-limited).
- **VIP investigation** (optional): `HAVEIBEENPWNED_API_KEY` adds breach-exposure to the service-discoverability
  score. `BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY` adds name-**mention volume** to the online-presence score (knowledge-panel, result
  density and news coverage → H/M/L), blended with account footprint so presence is High if strong on either axis.
  Without these keys those signals degrade gracefully (presence uses account footprint only; everything else works).
  The geo-risk tiers are overridable: copy `geo_risk.example.json` to `geo_risk.json` (gitignored) at the repo root,
  or point `OSIRIS_GEO_RISK_FILE` at a file — either `{"high": [...], "medium": [...], "low": [...]}` or a flat
  `{"country": "high"}` map (case-insensitive; file entries win over the built-in defaults). A VIP scorecard can be
  exported as a print-friendly **PDF report** or **JSON** from the dashboard.
- **Screenshots** (optional) — capture suspect/lookalike/clone pages headlessly. Install once:
  `pip install -r requirements-screenshots.txt && playwright install chromium`. Without it, the camera button
  shows a clear "install to enable" message and nothing else is affected.
- **Monitoring alerts** (optional) — when a monitor run (Run monitor button or `osiris --monitor`) finds new
  lookalikes, Osiris can push a notification. Telegram: set `OSIRIS_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` (from @BotFather) and
  `OSIRIS_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`. Generic webhook: set `OSIRIS_ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL` (Osiris POSTs `{"text", "data"}` —
  point it at an internal endpoint to keep alert data off external services). Both are off unless set; use the
  Monitor tab's **Send test** button to verify wiring. Note: alerts push finding data to the configured channel.

### Tests

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest
```

### Config File (JSON)

Osiris can also load settings from a JSON config file using `--config`.
It searches for these files by default: `osiris.config.json`, `osiris.json`, or `~/.osiris.json`.

Example:

```json
{
  "user_agent": "Osiris/1.0 (corp-audit)",
  "request_timeout": 12,
  "rate_limit_per_sec": 3,
  "http_proxy": "http://127.0.0.1:8080",
  "https_proxy": "http://127.0.0.1:8080",
  "verify_tls": true,
  "json_output": false
}
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- **Permission denied running `osiris`**: Run from the Osiris project root (the folder that contains `osiris`, `src/`, and `README.md`) and ensure it's executable with `chmod +x osiris`.
- **macOS: `./osiris` still permission denied**: Remove quarantine and ensure Unix line endings:
  - `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine ./osiris`
  - `sed -i '' -e 's/\r$//' ./osiris`
- **macOS: `osiris` command not found after install**: Add the pip bin directory to your PATH:
  - `export PATH="$HOME/Library/Python/3.9/bin:$PATH"`
  - Add the line to `~/.zshrc` (zsh) or `~/.bash_profile` (bash), then restart the shell.
  - Verify resolution:
    - `which osiris`
    - `osiris --help`
- **`pip install` fails**: Try upgrading pip (`pip install --upgrade pip`) or check network/proxy settings.
- **Python version mismatch**: Make sure you run with `python3` if your system defaults to Python 2.
